# AAHLS_LabB_cordic

## Description of the function
  Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) is a simple and efficient algorithm for trigonometric functions based on vector rotations
## Build flow
1. Creat a vitis project and add the source code in src/
2. Run CSIM and COSIM to verify the function
3. Export the RTL code
4. Creat a vivado project and connect the IP to the PYNQ processor






6. Find the overlay file(.bit & .hwh) in the vivado folder
7. Upload the overlay to the FPGA and use the host code to control the kernel
## Result / Analysis

## Platform 
Xilinx PYNQ-z2
